# Honeypot-Implementation
This project involves building a custom honeypot system that simulates real network services like SSH, FTP, and HTTP to attract attackers, monitor unauthorized access attempts, and analyze malicious behavior.

📌 Features
🎯 Service Emulation: Mimics SSH (port 22), FTP (port 21), HTTP (port 80), and HTTPS (port 443) to lure attackers.

📝 Attack Logging: Captures key details such as attacker IPs, timestamps, and command payloads in structured JSON logs.

📊 Real-Time Dashboard: Uses a Flask API to serve log data to a web-based dashboard with visualizations and trend analysis.

📈 Threat Reports: Generates reports summarizing attack frequency, commonly targeted ports, and popular payloads.

🌐 Expandable Integration: Designed for potential integration with SIEM systems for advanced threat intelligence.
